# Elevate Labs - Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

## Dataset: Target E-commerce Dataset
- **Source:** [Target Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv)  
- This dataset contains structured e-commerce data covering products, customers, sellers, orders, payments, and reviews. It is suitable for practicing SQL queries for data analysis, aggregation, and joining multiple tables.

## Objective
To write and execute SQL queries that extract, manipulate, and analyze structured e-commerce data, demonstrating core SQL skills including filtering, grouping, joining, subqueries, and query optimization.

## Tools Used
- MySQL 8.0 (Workbench)
- Target E-commerce Dataset (CSV files)
- GitHub for submission and documentation

## SQL Concepts Covered
- **Basic Querying** — `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- **Joins** — `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- **Subqueries** — Nested queries for advanced filtering and aggregation
- **Aggregate Functions** — `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- **Views** — Creating reusable query views for reporting
- **Optimization** — Use of indexes and efficient filtering
